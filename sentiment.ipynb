       "\"This is one of my favourite spot if you're looking for fresh hand pulled noodles \\xa0This location is fairly popular and busy, so we were lucky to have been to get a seat during lunch time as spots filled up quickly. Their menu offers a range of appetizers, soup noodles, stir fried noodles and more!We wanted to try their soup noodle and an appetizer, and wow, I was surprised by the size of the large bowl. We got the Braised Beef Noodles with one spice, and as someone who can eat some spicy dishes, level 2 wouldn't hurt - however still flavourful! There were many chunks by braised beef, and not just skin. The noodles were very bouncy, and you can definitely definitely taste the difference between fresh noodles VS frozen. You could also choose the noodle style to go with \\xa0your bowl. We opted for flat, but perhaps will try the thin flat next time as it was on the thicker side, and I got full really fast from it. Definitely enjoyed this dish overall I'm hoping to try all their noodles, so yes, I will be coming back! If you never heard about them, this is your chance to try!IG: Ayenomz\""
