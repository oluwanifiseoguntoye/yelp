# Yelp Review Sentiment Analysis
## Overview
This is a sentiment analysis project that extracts reviews for a particular restaurant on Yelp, preprocesses the data using BeautifulSoup and regex, and uses the Transformers library and PyTorch to perform sentiment analysis on the reviews. The resulting sentiment scores are then used to generate a sentiment analysis DataFrame.
